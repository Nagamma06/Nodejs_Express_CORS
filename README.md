# Nodejs Express CORS
Understanding and Working on CORS by enabling CORS in Nodejs application using Express and CORS middleware

## Introduction 
- By default web browser prevents requests from unknown websites from accessing your API's and services.
- This means , our server shares its resourses only with the clients that are from same domain (i.e domain on which our server is created)
### Why and When CORS is needed?
 - CORS is important for Node.js applications because it allows them to make requests to other domains.
 - This is useful for applications that need to access data from other APIs or that need to authenticate users with a third-party service.
### What is CORS?
- Node.js with CORS is a server-side JavaScript solution for building scalable and secure cross-origin web APIs.
- To enable CORS in Node.js, you can use the cors package. This package provides a middleware that can be used to add CORS headers to your responses.
